Welcome to Challenge 1
Find here the explanation of the files.

challenge 1_1.sh creates text file with my bacteria genomes
challenge 1_2.sh creates folder gff and fasta and copies/unzips the correct files there
-> using only one core
challenge1fasta.sh und challenge1gff.sh split the task and can be run simulaneously
